                <br> This is a must have every time I leave my house. How else would I lock the door, anyway? It holds some of my most essential keys: for the house, for my car, and for my bike. I also have my favorite keyfob with my initials engraved onto it, and a keychain that my sister made for me.</p>

                <br> As a Design major, having a mouse is convenient when working with the adobe software. It speeds up the work process and makes everything much easier. This is why I like to keep it in my backpack with me at all times!

                <br> I'm such a music lover, so it is important that I have my earphones with me in case I want to listen to my jams while in school or during commute. It also allows me to watch some videos while I'm waiting in between classes. It's important to be considerate while listening to anything, which is why I keep it with me.

                <br>In my classes, I find myself writing papers often. Therefore, I need a stapler just in case I need to put my work together. This little thing has saved me so many times! And it's always nice to have it around in case a friend might need to staple their papers as well.

                <br>Of course, I always need to have my wallet around. It has my money, ids, credit cards, etc, a.k.a. it holds my life. It's the only way I can buy myself food, which makes it #1.</p>
